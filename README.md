# graphicalPathFinding

In this repository it is graphically shown how path finding algorithms (currently only A*) explore a graph.

## It starts by the user defining a start- and end-vertex. Additionally one has the option to block vertices.

![Start](/img/start.png)

## Then each explored vertex is colored in the order they are visited.

![Calculating](/img/calculating.png)

## And finally the resulting shortest path is shown.
